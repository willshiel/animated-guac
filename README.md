# Epl Pick Em

## A new way to play fantasy soccer
Traditional fantasy soccer games allow users to select a team of players and the score they get depends on how well the players perform.
In Epl Pick Em,  users select the winner of each game along with the margin and the final score is a combination of the games they selected correctly and the margins they selected correctly.  It is head to head against an opponent and there is a table and a playoff system.  Ultimately it gives users a fantasy soccer game that's enjoyable without as much team maintanence.
